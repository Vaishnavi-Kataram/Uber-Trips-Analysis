# Uber Trips Analysis

This project involves the analysis and visualization of Uber trips data using Python, with a focus on extracting meaningful insights. The primary tools utilized are pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for visualization. The analysis covers various aspects such as trips by the hours in a day, trips during every day of the month, trips during weekdays, number of trips by bases, correlation heatmap between weekday and hour, and scatter plot visualization of geographic locations.

Key Objectives:

Trips by Hours in a Day: Explore and visualize the distribution of Uber trips throughout the day to identify peak hours and trends.

Trips During Every Day of the Month: Analyze the variation in trip volume across different days of the month to uncover patterns or anomalies.

Trips During Weekdays: Investigate the number of trips occurring on each weekday, providing insights into weekly trends.

Number of Trips by Bases: Break down the trips based on different Uber bases, giving a perspective on the distribution of rides among different service areas.

Correlation Heatmap: Generate a heatmap to showcase the correlation between the weekday and hour of the day, revealing potential relationships and dependencies.

Scatter Plot Visualization of Geographic Locations: Create scatter plots to visualize the geographic distribution of trips, providing insights into popular pickup and drop-off locations.

Technologies Used:
	•	Python
	•	Pandas for data manipulation
	•	Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
 
The analysis and visualizations derived from this project aim to enhance understanding and provide actionable insights for optimizing Uber services.
